# ROC Tool

ROC Tool is a tool that allows the user to visualize ROC curves and easily perform more advanced analysis on them. Specifically, the tool allows users to plot multiple ROC curves and their Regions of Interest, compute AUC and RRA, and plot multiple iso-PM curves.

For more information on how Regions of Interest, RRA, and iso-PM curves work, refer to the following paper: [XXXX]. 

If you use this tool for your research, please reference that paper.
